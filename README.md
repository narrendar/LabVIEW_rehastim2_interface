LabVIEW-based hardware-level control of Rehastim 2
Hasomed’s RehaStim 2 is a widely used stimulator for neurorehabilitation research. Using the serial communication protocol - ScienceMode2, direct hardware-level control of the stimulator is realized. This protocol facilitates bidirectional communication between a PC and the stimulator that enables the testing of novel stimulation strategies. By utilizing this communication protocol, the aim of this work is to demonstrate a similar hardware-level control through LabVIEW’s virtual instrumentation platform. Additionally, the LabVIEW-based implementation is made openly available for researchers to leverage the full potential of the stimulator for research applications.
